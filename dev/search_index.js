These views are combined by a separate worker task, and once all the information on a geometry has been read, it is processed by a second worker task.\n\nHowever, this approach could potentially change.  If we know the statistic is separable and associative (like a histogram with fixed bins, or mean, min, max, etc.), we could simply process the partial geometries in the same task that reads the tile, and recombine at the end.   This would allow us to avoid the (cognitive) overhead of  managing separate channels and worker tasks.  But it would be a bit less efficient and less general over the space of zonal functions.
